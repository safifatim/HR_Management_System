# HR Management System – Java Swing

This project is a Java-based HR Management System developed using Java Swing. It provides a graphical user interface to manage employee records while demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures concepts.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
The system is designed to perform basic human resource management tasks in an organized and efficient manner. It allows users to manage employee data, track attendance, and calculate salaries through a user-friendly GUI.

The application supports:
- Employee registration and record management
- Automatic sorting of employee data
- Efficient searching of employee records
- Attendance tracking (entry and exit time)
- Salary calculation based on working hours

---

## 🧱 System Modules

### 1. Employee Class
- Stores employee information:
  - Employee Name
  - Employee ID
  - Entry Time
  - Exit Time
- Acts as the main data model of the system

---

### 2. Sorting Module (Selection Sort)
- Employees are sorted based on Employee ID
- Selection Sort algorithm is used
- Sorting is performed after employee registration
- Sorted employee data is displayed through the GUI

**Why Selection Sort?**
- Simple and easy to implement
- Suitable for small datasets
- Commonly taught in academic courses
- Helps in understanding basic comparison-based sorting

---

### 3. Searching Module (Binary Search)
- Employee records are searched using Binary Search
- Binary Search operates on sorted employee data
- Provides faster search compared to linear search
- Used for:
  - Recording entry time
  - Recording exit time
  - Salary calculation

---

### 4. Interview Module
- Displays predefined interview questions
- Implemented using a scrollable Java Swing window
- Simulates a basic interview process

---

### 5. Attendance Management
- Entry and exit times are recorded automatically
- System time is captured using Java Time API
- Ensures accurate attendance tracking

---

### 6. Salary Calculation
- Salary is calculated using:
  - Entry time
  - Exit time
  - Fixed hourly rate
- Working hours are computed using time difference logic
